(1) Sorted Input - Binary Search or Modified Binary Search 
(2) Shortest Path/Distance/Hops - BFS/Queue/Only Iterative
(3) Nodes/Vertices + Relation between vertices/Edges - Graph problem
(4) Rolling Hash - Can be used for substring checks for pattern matching on largre input streams or huge files comparisons
(5) AutoComplete Functionality - Definitely uses suffix tries
(6) Bitwise Operators: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/bitwise-operators-in-c-cpp/
